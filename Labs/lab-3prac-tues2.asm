;Write an ALP that will examine a set of signed 8-bit nos. and find the smallest positive no. (for e.g. in
;a set of nos. 80h, 21h,92h,45h â€“ smallest positive no. is 21h). The numbers are stored from location
;dat1, the count of the nos. is stored in location cnt1 and the smallest positive number must be stored
;in location res1.
